This project is a puzzle game meant to relax the mind the players mind, and inspire the player to be a hero. 

Unity was used to make this project.

I struggled with the buttons dissapearing from my screen at times. The solution was setting a smaller ration to the screen. There were also times where the game didn't work 
as expected eventhough the code was correct. In these times I had to restart Unity and everything would be fixed.
